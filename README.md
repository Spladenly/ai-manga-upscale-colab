"4x_eula_digimanga_bw_v2_nc1_307k" is an AI model that was made specifically for manga upscaling. The result is very interesting and unlike waifu2x, the output files aren't large. This model requires a fairly powerful Nvidia GPU (unfortunately, ESRGAN does not support AMD GPUs). So, this notebook will give you the opportunity to run this model on Google's servers using their free and powerful GPU.

It's also possible to upscale color pages using the "4x-AnimeSharp" model.
